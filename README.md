Single-spa application example which imports registered applications from NPM packages and manages authentication features as login.

## ✍🏻 Motivation

## ▶️ Demo

You can see a working demo of this application in the next link: [https://single-spa-with-npm-packages.herokuapp.com](https://single-spa-with-npm-packages.herokuapp.com/).

The login validation is harcoded in code and the credentials are:

| User          | Password      |     
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| admin         | 12345         |

## 💻 Run in localhost

If you prefer run this application in localhost you must follow next steps:
